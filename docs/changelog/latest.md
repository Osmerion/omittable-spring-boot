### 1.0.0

_Released 2026 Jan 14_

#### Overview

The modules providing support for integrating [Omittable](https://github.com/Osmerion/Omittable) with third-party
libraries and frameworks have been split off into their own repositories to simplify development of current and future
integrations.

This repository now only contains the code for the Spring Boot support libraries.
